            <p>❤️ OMGGGG HAPPY BIRTHDAY GEETHA. I had no idea how to send this message to you at midnight so IF you see this, I would like to say I am a genius because I figured it outt!
</p>
            <p>Anyways its your birthdayyyyyy and omgggggg happy happy birthday once again. And as I am en route traveling at subsonic speeds to reach you, you have the limited pleasure of only viewing this message. God, I wish I was there to see you!! Geetha before even I get to the emotional and mushy stuff, I wanna say a few other things. Idk if any1 has said this to you already but I am so proud proud of you. Weird? Nopeee. I am so proud of the way you have been handling everything and everything that went on in your life over the last 1 year. If I could turn back time, we were in our last sem (8th sem didn't exist for us, and yes US), stressing about life, college exams and what will I be doing. Ironically, I am in the same boat, but look at YOUUUU. You are all settled, and doing amazing at NatWest, and I could not be happier. Genuinely, I am so happy about your journey this entire way. </p>
            <p>Anyways, ever since last year, we have been through a long, long journey. One with sounds of joy and laughter and the silence of spilled tears. But today, I step back and take a look at both me and you. If you told me one year back, Geetha would have said, " I love youuu soo many times that she would find a way to constantlyyyyy be on call with me for sooo many hours, for us to literally stay togetherrrr even if we are worlds apart. I would have looked at you and been like ''yeah good one!" And I for one, never even believed I could loveeee someone this muchhh. I can confidently say that there is something in you that is irresistible to me. </p>
            <p>Maybe it's the way you lookkkk, and omggg Ik i say it sooo often you are going to rolll your eyes but you are the prettiest, most stunning girl i have ever laid my eyes on. Or maybe it's the wayy you make every conversation seem soooo funnn, and we always have something exciting to discussss or talk. Or maybe it is the amount you have changed just for me. You won't believe the difference I see in you. All because I asked. Believe me, I cannot feel more loved because when I think of you, I see the person who has adjusted sooo well and sooo much just for me. Orrr maybe, its every second you have stood by me, at my best or worst. I would say this year has been was like the wonderla ride we went. It goes uppp and then downnn and then sidewaysss and then when I thought it was over, it goes backward and repeats the samee thing. And the only constant thing was you. You were there for me whenever I needed, and trust me, even the luckiest man on earth could not get that. Actually no, scratch that, I am the luckiest man on earth because of that. Because it's easy to find money, there are a million ways to make it. It's easy to find pretty much anything in this world, except this. This being someone you can trust, someone you know you who will stick up for you, someone who will fight the world for you, someone who you can share not just a laugh with, but an entire life with. And that is you di. You are that to me, you are nothing short of the person I want to be with forever (ironically you are short haha pls dont kill me) </p>

            <p>I really think that God sent you and let you right to me not just so that I could have companyy but to prove that literally anything is possiblee. If you had told me 2 years back I would have fallen this hard for a girl, I would have probably said no. Actually, I might have said yes because I was a teeny tiny bit desperate but the wait was sooooo worth the time. Come to think of this, none of this makes sense. Remember our first-ever conversation! We both knew that we wanted different things and we both felt that ok, this person is only going to be our friend. Oh, how wrong were we? And I am sooo happy I was wrong because I cannot imagine myself here without you. There are soo many things I love in you. Right from the way you say 'Good Morning', it just makes my heart skip a lotta beats, to the way you always laugh at the most stupidest things I doo. To even the random bullying (completely undeserved btw, shame on you for bullying me soo much) which I will never admit I love, to the fact that we seem to never be able to cut the call. It is almost as if the universe tells us to cut the call by adding random events like the bus reaching the stop or my assignment being due. </p>
            <p>Another hugee factor is the last 4 months. I would say that I was soo certain that this journey would be hard, and I assumed the hardest fact would be maintaining my entire equation with you. I was soo scared that we would slowly lose touch or let our lives prevent us from talking to each other BUT no. I am soo glad and happy we found a way to still be so close emotionally. When I say I miss you, I do mean I miss you being close to me and the amazing moments we have had in the past. But I also mean that I miss having you in my life all the time. I would love for you to be with me here, meet my friends, give me company when I need to study late at night, and I would love to meet all your friends and colleagues at workk! I miss us being in the same environment together because you were an amazing best friend, and still are to me. Every time I think of you, I also remember how funnn, entertaining, and amazing you are. You never cease to surprise or impress me (sometimes, I wonder how stupid and smart you could be, more of the former xD) in every conversation we have! </p>
            <p>If I had one wish, I would say I wish you really don't change (well maybe a bit, you could grow taller, or you could get more tea from others and tell me) or lose who you are. Because I need you to believe me when I say this, you are perfect. I know there are times in the past when I have requested or asked you to change this or that, but boy oh boy, was I so wrong. It took time but I am at a point where I realize all this while, you were already perfect. In pretty much every way, the way you steal the show with every dress, the way you talk on call for HOURSSS, the way you never let the convo ruin my mood, the way you immediately get sad when I get hurt and do everything to make me feel happyyy, the way you tell me every single detail of your life, right from when you last had pani puri, to what the guy sitting next to you during work said, to every single drop of delicious tea you obtain, to the way you pretty much always reply and try to talk and text more, to even the times you put up with me when I was being stupid or annoying (yes it's so rare I cannot think of a single example but shush, you do not need to remind me of one even if it comes across your mind) and finally, to you just being a lovely lovely lovely human with the best principles and morals I have ever seen. You never back down or give up on your morals, even when it goes against those closest to you. And I respect you soo soo much for all of it. </p>
            
            <p>With that being said, I would like to wish you a veryyy veryy happy birthdayyyy. Maybe you might have circled the Sun about 23 times, but to me, you still are the most mature person I have ever seen. And don't worry, I am sure you are younger in heart (and brain, trust me, that aint growing). I am sorry if I was a bit too rude in the brackets (I couldn't help myself), and I really am sorry I could not do anything in person! I hope this puts a smile on your face, and I shall continue to try putting one on your face daily.  And I just want to say I love youuu to the moon, and back and beyond! I hope we get to spend more birthdays together, and look forward to celebrating each and every year with youuu. And ik the future is uncertain, but I am 200% in one thing only - if it's meant to be, it will be. ❤️</p>
