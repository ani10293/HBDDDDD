            ‚ù§Ô∏è OMGGGG HAPPY BIRTHDAY GEETHA. I had no idea how to send this message to you at midnight so IF you see this, I would like to say I am a genius because I figured it outt!

            Anyways its your birthdayyyyyy and omgggggg happy happy birthday once again. And as I am en route traveling at subsonic speeds to reach you, you have the limited pleasure of only viewing this message. God, I wish I was there to see you!! Geetha before even I get to the emotional and mushy stuff, I wanna say a few other things. Idk if any1 has said this to you already but I am so proud proud of you. Weird? Nopeee. I am so proud of the way you have been handling everything and everything that went on in your life over the last 1 year. If I could turn back time, we were in our last sem (8th sem didn't exist for us, and yes US), stressing about life, college exams and what will I be doing. Ironically, I am in the same boat, but look at YOUUUU. You are all settled, and doing amazing at NatWest, and I could not be happier. Genuinely, I am so happy about our journey this entire way.
            Anyways, ever since last year, we have been through a long, long journey. One with sounds of joy and laughter and the silence of spilled tears. But today, I step back and take a look at both me and you. If you told me one year back, Geetha would have said, " I love youuu soo many times that she would find a way to constantlyyyyy be on call with me for sooo many hours, for us to literally stay togetherrrr even if we are worlds apart. I would have looked at you and been like ''yeah good one!" And I for one, never even believed I could loveeee someone this muchhh. I can confidently say that there is something in you that is irresistible to me. 
            Maybe it's the way you lookkkk, and omggg Ik i say it sooo often you are going to rolll your eyes but you are the prettiest, most stunning girl i have ever laid my eyes on. Or maybe it's the wayy you make every conversation seem soooo funnn, and we always have something exciting to discussss or talk. Or maybe it is the amount you have changed just for me. You won't believe the difference I see in you. All because I asked. Believe me, I cannot feel more loved because when I think of you, I see the person who has adjusted sooo well and sooo much just for me. Orrr maybe, its every second you have stood by me, at my best or worst. I would say this year has been was like the wonderla ride we went. 
            It goes uppp and then downnn and then sidewaysss and then when I thought it was over, it goes backward and repeats the samee thing. And the only constant thing was you. You were there for me whenever I needed, and trust me, even the luckiest man on earth could not get that. Actually no, scratch that, I am the luckiest man on earth because of that. Because it's easy to find money, there are a million ways to make it. It's easy to find pretty much anything in this world, except this. This being someone you can trust, someone you know you who will stick up for you, someone who will fight the world for you, someone who you can share not just a laugh with, but an entire life with. And that is you di. You are that to me, you are nothing short of the person I want to be with forever (ironically you are short haha pls dont kill me) ‚ù§Ô∏è
